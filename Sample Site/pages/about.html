        <h3>Ronaldo Excellent</h3>
        In the year 2022, I upgraded my ability to solve web frontend problems and even wrote my first web game (https://spellingbee1.vercel .app). Then I made few other games, because making websites was a bit boring. Then making more apps and games no longer became a major objective. I was still unsatisfied and wanted to do more than just writing apps and games. I thought of what I could create as a programmer that would help/benefit other programmers, then I thought of creating a very little library with some code snippets. I started out crazily and the end result was. After a few months, I decided to remake it and make it more complex, consisting of functions and some extra features that lets you bind and call application data and even external variables whenever and wherever you need them. I also added some special code to help solve some special problems, especially in the area of design and functionality. The former (nano-sized) library, now a (micro) framework is finally ready.
